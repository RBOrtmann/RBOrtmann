## Welcome to my profile!

I recently finished my senior project, [YADA](https://github.com/Yet-Another-Data-Aggregator/yada-web). A live demo can be found [here](https://yada-demo.netlify.app).

As a recent college graduate, I'm primarily looking for software development and engineering jobs in the Charlotte, NC area.
